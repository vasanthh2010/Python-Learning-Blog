# Educational Port Scanner üîç

A simple, educational Python-based port scanner designed to help students and developers learn about networking concepts, socket programming, and cybersecurity fundamentals.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

**IMPORTANT**: This tool is designed strictly for educational purposes. Only use this scanner on:
- Systems you own
- Networks you have explicit permission to test
- Local testing environments (localhost, private VMs)

Unauthorized port scanning may be illegal in your jurisdiction and violate computer security laws. Always obtain proper authorization before scanning any system or network.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Simple TCP Connect Scanning**: Uses basic socket connections to check port availability
- **Service Identification**: Attempts to identify common services running on open ports
- **Customizable Port Ranges**: Scan specific port ranges or all ports (1-65535)
- **Adjustable Timeout**: Configure connection timeouts for different network conditions
- **Real-time Results**: Displays open ports as they're discovered
- **Clean Output**: Well-formatted scan results with timestamps
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles network errors and connection issues
- **Keyboard Interrupt Support**: Safely exit scans with Ctrl+C

## üîß Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Basic understanding of networking concepts
- Permission to scan the target system

## üì¶ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Educational-Port-Scanner.git
cd Educational-Port-Scanner
```

2. No external dependencies required! This scanner uses only Python standard library modules:
   - `socket` - Network communication
   - `sys` - System operations
   - `datetime` - Timestamp formatting
   - `argparse` - Command-line argument parsing

3. Make the script executable (Linux/Mac):
```bash
chmod +x port_scanner.py
```

## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Syntax

```bash
python port_scanner.py <target> [options]
```

### Command-Line Options

| Option | Short | Description | Default |
|--------|-------|-------------|---------|
| `target` | - | Target hostname or IP address (required) | - |
| `--start` | `-s` | Starting port number | 1 |
| `--end` | `-e` | Ending port number | 1024 |
| `--timeout` | `-t` | Connection timeout in seconds | 1.0 |

### Help Command

```bash
python port_scanner.py --help
```

## üí° Examples

### Scan common ports on localhost
```bash
python port_scanner.py localhost
```

### Scan specific port range
```bash
python port_scanner.py 192.168.1.1 -s 20 -e 100
```

### Scan well-known ports with custom timeout
```bash
python port_scanner.py example.com -s 1 -e 1024 -t 0.5
```

### Scan all ports (warning: takes a long time!)
```bash
python port_scanner.py 127.0.0.1 -s 1 -e 65535
```

### Scan common web ports
```bash
python port_scanner.py mywebsite.com -s 80 -e 8080
```

## üìö How It Works

### TCP Connect Scanning

This scanner uses the TCP connect scanning method, which:

1. **Creates a socket**: Establishes a TCP socket connection
2. **Attempts connection**: Tries to connect to each port in the specified range
3. **Checks result**: If connection succeeds, the port is marked as open
4. **Closes socket**: Properly closes each connection after testing

### Port States

- **OPEN**: A service is actively accepting connections on this port
- **Not displayed**: Ports that are closed or filtered aren't shown in output

### Service Identification

The scanner attempts to identify services using Python's `socket.getservbyport()` function, which maps port numbers to common service names (e.g., port 80 ‚Üí HTTP, port 22 ‚Üí SSH).

## üéì Educational Value

This project demonstrates:

- **Socket Programming**: Creating and managing network sockets in Python
- **TCP/IP Networking**: Understanding how TCP connections work
- **Port Concepts**: Learning about port numbers and common services
- **Error Handling**: Implementing robust error handling for network operations
- **Command-Line Tools**: Building user-friendly CLI applications with argparse
- **Cybersecurity Awareness**: Understanding reconnaissance techniques used in security testing

- Create comprehensive unit tests

### Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Add docstrings to all functions
- Include comments for complex logic
- Write descriptive commit messages

## üìñ Common Ports Reference

| Port | Service | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| 20-21 | FTP | File Transfer Protocol |
| 22 | SSH | Secure Shell |
| 23 | Telnet | Unencrypted remote access |
| 25 | SMTP | Email transmission |
| 53 | DNS | Domain Name System |
| 80 | HTTP | Web traffic |
| 443 | HTTPS | Secure web traffic |
| 3306 | MySQL | MySQL database |
| 5432 | PostgreSQL | PostgreSQL database |
| 8080 | HTTP-Alt | Alternative HTTP port |

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Cannot resolve hostname" error
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the hostname/IP address is correct
- Try using an IP address instead of hostname

### "Could not connect to server" error
- Target host may be down or blocking connections
- Firewall may be blocking your scan attempts
- Network connectivity issues

### Slow scanning
- Reduce the timeout value: `-t 0.3`
- Scan smaller port ranges
- Check your network speed
